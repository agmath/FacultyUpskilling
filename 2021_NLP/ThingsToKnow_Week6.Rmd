Here are a few reminders and some things to be on the look-out for in Chapter 4.

  + **REMINDER:** The default mirror for `gutenberg_download()` is still non-functioning. Please continue using the mirror site you've been using up to this point.
  
  + **NEW PACKAGES:** The following packages are new this week and will need to be installed prior to use: `tm`, `topicmodels`, `quanteda`
  
  + **NEW CODE:** Sometimes it isn't worth loading an entire package because we only need its functionality once or twice. In these cases, we can use the syntax `package_name::function_name()` to use the function `function_name()` from the package `package_name` without first loading `package_name` into our R Session.

That's all for now. Post questions you have in Slack and/or bring them with you to our Thursday live meeting.
